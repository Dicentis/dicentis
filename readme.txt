Dicentis is a new podcast plugin which has its main focus on CMS based Websites. With Dicentis it is possible to offer multiple podcasts with one WordPress installation.

== Description ==
Most podcast plugin for WordPress are great but have one weakness: They focus on single podcast sites. It is not easy or impossible to create multiple podcast feeds with on installation. This plugin wants to change that. It is possible to add multiple podcast and support individual feeds for different media types. In addition, you can add series and speaker to episodes for a better archive and to enhance episodes with more meta data.
